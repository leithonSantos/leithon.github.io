<h1>The Growth of Gaming How the pandemic <br>
    has sparked fresh opportunities.</h1>
    <ul>
       <li> With lockdown measures and movement restrictions, many people have<br>
        been spending more time at home,which has led to a significant increase <br>
        in time spent playing video games. This has boosted sale of video games<br> 
        and consoles, as well as participation in online gaming platforms.</li><br>
       <li>The need to maintain social connections during the pandemic has led to <br>
        a surge in the popularity of online and multiplayer gaming. Games like<br>
         "Among Us," "Fortnite," "Call of Duty: Warzone," and "Animal Crossing:<br>
          New Horizons" have all seen spikes in popularity due to their ability <br>
          to connect people across digital platforms.</li><br>
        <li>The pandemic has attracted new players, including those who weren't <br>
            previously video game fans. The accessibility and variety of games<br>
             available have made more people interested in video games as a form <br>
             of entertainment and socializing.</li>
