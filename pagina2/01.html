                <h1> What happens when older PCs get<br>
                     modern updates?</h1>
                     <p>Modern upgrades are often optimized for newer hardware. On older computers, <br>
                        this can result in slower performance, as the hardware can't handle the <br>
                        demands of the new software efficiently.<br>
                        <br>
                        Modern upgrades tend to require more resources, such as RAM and processing <br>
                        power. Older PCs, which have lower specs, may struggle to meet these <br>
                        requirements, which can cause slowdowns and crashes.<br>
                        <br>
                        Some older hardware components, such as graphics cards, network cards, or <br>
                        storage drives, may not be compatible with modern drivers. This can lead to <br>
                        malfunctions or lack of support for certain devices.
